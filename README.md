Repo for assignment 2 announcement and discussion.

## Filename format
As we have 2 programs in this assignment, please name you file as:
 - `Prog-1.c`
 - `Prog-2.c`

If you don't write in C, C++ is also acceptable, just replace the extension `.c` with `.cpp`, please don't seperate your program to multiple header and class files, only one file for each program.

## Commit requirement
Please **at least** commit each program for **two** commits, don't do them all in a single commit.

## Input / Output

We use standart input(stdin) and standard output(stdout) as the input and output of the programs, not files.

The inputs will be multiple numbers that be seperated by space, tab or newline character, and end  with a `x` alphabet, there will be at most 10000 inputs.

Here is an example of the input:
`-2  1  -3  4 -1  2  1  -5  4  x`

The corresponding output should be:
`6`
